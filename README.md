# object-detector-comparison
Comparing the performance of object detectors such as YOLOv3, YOLOv4, and EfficientDet.

Thanks to https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet for the YOLO detectors and https://github.com/google/automl/tree/master/efficientdet for the EfficientDet detectors, as well as https://pjreddie.com for the original YOLO detector and weights for the YOLOv3 detector.
